	 * inserted into the parent expression, brackets will be added were necessary.
	 * As both, addition and multiplication are associative, brackets are not needed
	 * in most situations. The only case where brackets are needed is if an addition
	 * is the left or right child of a multiplication, as multiplication binds
	 * stronger than addition.
